# my-bash-scripts
A collection of bash scripts and shortcuts in .sh and .txt files
## Folders:
There are two sets of folders:\
-**bash** *for bash files*\
-**text** *for text files which are in essence shortcuts, reminders, tutorils, etc* 
### Purpose
So that I never get stuck on something I've done before on the $SHELL
