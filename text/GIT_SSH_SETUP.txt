##GIT SSH SETUP

#should be in home folder
#Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ git config --global user.name "BongweKE"
$ git config --global user.email "bongwe.obi@gmail.com"

#I also do:

$ git config --global color.ui true
$ git config --global core.editor code
#The first of these will enable colored output in the terminal; the second tells git that you want to use emacs.

#Set up ssh on your computer. I like Roger Peng’s guide to setting up password-less logins. Also see github’s guide to generating SSH keys.

#Look to see if you have files ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
#If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

#Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard. On a Mac, in the terminal/shell, type:

#use mousepad, cat or nano to check ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.


#Go to your github Account Settings
#-Click “SSH Keys” on the left.
#-Click “Add SSH Key” on the right.
#-Add a label (like “Kali”) and paste the public key into the big text box.
#In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
#If it says something like the following, it worked:

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
not provide shell access.
